        I chose Animal Cruelty as my Final Project Topic because animals hold a very permanent spot in my heart. I grew up with animals, and I have never lived a single second without  having a pet. Animals have helped me cope through a lot of things and I can not understand why people would hurt such loving animals. For my project I decided to focus on animal cruelty rates in the United States and how the statistics connect.
